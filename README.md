## Custom Fork of discord.py with Components V2 made by me (tess)

This repository is a fork of:

- **[DA-344/d.py](https://github.com/DA-344/d.py)** (for Components V2) 

- **[Rapptz/discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)** (as the base).  

### Disclaimer
It is intended for **personal use** only. You can use, download or modify it if you want, but **I do not provide any support** or care, i sometimes update this if new features come out and arent yet updated on default discord.py / pycord.  


### SAINT#0011
This lib is intended for my personal bot and is combined with saintcord `pip install saintcord` its a great lib combined with this.

### Install  

To install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/egirlst/discord.git
